# Yelp_application
Yelp application to search users and business.
The primary users for this desktop application will be potential customers seeking for businesses and users that match their search criteria.
This application will have a user interface that provides the user the available business categories (main, sub-categories), the attributes associated with each business category along with business review and yelp user information associated with each business category.
Using this application the user will search for the businesses from various business categories that have the properties (attributes) the user is looking for.
This uses Faceted search to drill down the search results by applying some criteria.
The user can filter the search results using available business attributes (i.e. facets) such as category, sub-category, attributes, reviews, stars and votes. Each time the user clicks on a facet value; the set of results is reduced to only the items that have that value. Additional clicks continue to narrow down the searchâ€”the previous facet values are remembered and applied again.
